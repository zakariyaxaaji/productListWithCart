## Overview

Welcome to my solution for the Frontend Mentor challenge. This project involves creating a product list where users can browse and add items to their cart. The goal was to implement this using React, focusing on creating a responsive, dynamic interface that enhances user interaction.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add items to the cart and remove them
- Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

Since this was one of my first projects using React, my approach was largely experimental. I started by analyzing the design and identifying potential components, then built each one incrementally. My process evolved as I worked, but it generally involved breaking down the UI into logical parts, creating components for each, and styling them along the way.

As I continue to refine my skills, I aim to establish a more structured process for future projects.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

As a newcomer to React, this project significantly accelerated my learning. I gained substantial experience with the Context API and worked extensively with JavaScript, more than in any previous project. I also became proficient in using props to manage component behavior and setting default values to ensure flexibility and reliability in my code.

Additionally, I learned how to implement portals for creating modals, enabling me to manage UI elements more effectively outside the usual DOM hierarchy. I also deepened my understanding of useEffect to handle side effects, optimizing component behavior and lifecycle management.

This project not only sharpened my React skills but also helped me build dynamic, reusable components efficiently while handling more complex UI scenarios.

### Continued development
 In the future, I plan to work on multi-page applications using React Router, and I aim to integrate external APIs or databases for data fetching and persistence.
